Check MPI partitionning

Read CFL from input file

The time step is fixed at initialisation, according to the CFL condition at t = 0.
If the state variation are small the CFL number stays the same.
If one wants to compute larger variations, the time step may need to be computed at each step from the CFL number.
Of course the iteration coast more.

Add ref values in input file, and plot relatively / remove ref velocity before plot + norm computation ...

Do I use pointer on local variables ? (heap/stack)
